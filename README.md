* Download [latest](https://github.com/farag2/Install-Office/releases/latest) archive and expand it

  ```

* Open expanded `Office` folder in PowerShell console and choose which Office to download

* Configure which components to download

  * There won't be any messages in console while Office is being downloaded
  * When Office is downloaded you can find a new `Office` folder in script folder.

* Run `.\Install.ps1` as admin to install Office you downloaded
